- Develop a presentation that demonstrates your findings to Janet. She has decided that your recommendation will determine if potential customers should take a fitness test as a component of their application. Your presentation should include the following:
    - A title slide
    - A description of what happened in this A/B test
    - A summary of your dataset and any information you think would be helpful background
    - The results of the three hypothesis tests that you ran, including an explanation of the type of test that you used and why it was appropriate
    - A summary of the qualitative data
    - A recommendation for MuscleHub

- Create a [wordcloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/) visualization that Janet can use to create an ad for the MuscleHub Gym with the data in `interviews.txt`.
